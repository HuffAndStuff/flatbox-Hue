# Flatbox Strong Buttons

This repo is to upload two copies of button cap replacements for the Flatbox fightstick. These buttons have the distinction of printing the inside vertically, so that the tab strength is higher (less chance of breaking on removal) and the tops can be printing horizontally, thus having a smooth finish. 

* Replaceable - two pieces with clearances to take the buttons apart, so you can change the buttons at any time. Recommended to use some double sided tape for a more secure connection <br>
* Non-Replaceable - Two pieces with tolerances tight enough that the two will not come back apart. Good if you want to only print them once and don't plan on replacing them for aesthetic reasons

  
_Note: These keycaps are 1.5mm taller to accommodate a top shell (part of a different project which will be uploaded when complete)_
