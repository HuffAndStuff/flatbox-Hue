# Flatbox Hue

This repo is to upload is to track changes made to the Flatbox v5, so I could make the buttons stronger, and customize the top to add some style. The idea being, I could either print top plates using Hueforge, or by printing them on printer paper and protecting the top with an Acrylic sheet. Inside the repo you'll also find two copies of button cap replacements for the Flatbox fightstick. 

## Button Replacements

These buttons have the distinction of printing the inside vertically, so that the tab strength is higher (less chance of breaking on removal) and the tops can be printing horizontally, thus having a smooth finish. 

* Replaceable - two pieces with clearances to take the buttons apart, so you can change the buttons at any time. Recommended to use some double sided tape for a more secure connection <br>
* Non-Replaceable - Two pieces with tolerances tight enough that the two will not come back apart. Good if you want to only print them once and don't plan on replacing them for aesthetic reasons

## Flatbox-rev5-Top-HUE.3mf

This is a replacement top case. This new top uses Heat Set inserts M3*6*5 (Although 7mm would be ideal, I couldn't find those) 

## TopPlate.svg

This is an SVG file, if you intend on printing a paper sheet, instead of using a Hueforge made plate, this can be cut in 1.5mm Acrylic to protect the paper

## TopPlateMakerV2.3mf

If you intend on using a Hueforge STL to make a top plate, you'll need to cut it to size. This 3mf file can be overlayed then subtracted from your HueForge STL to cut it to shape. 
  
_Note: These keycaps are 1.5mm taller to accommodate the top plates_
